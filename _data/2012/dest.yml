 The 36th annual was held on March 1 - 2, 2012, in the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations. The title of the conference was "Human Exploitation: Exposing the Unseen." The 2012 conference aimed to explore the hidden world of human exploitation through the various subsets of the topic, including child labor, human trafficking, and the sex trade, often caused by poverty, conflict, and more. The goal of 2012â€™s conference was to view the topic of Human Exploitation through a global perspective. Over the course of the conference, distinguished guest speakers addressed the various aspects of Human Exploitation.
 We aimed to develop a better understanding of Human Exploitation and its implication in our global society and in culture, and expose its many facets whilst encouraging participants to objectively develop their own opinions. Our ultimate goal was to raise awareness to the participants on Human Exploitation, a topic sometimes obscured from the media and news spotlight.
