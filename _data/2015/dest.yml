 In 2015, the conference topic was Sustainability: Balancing People, Planet and Profit. The Millennium Development Goals, which targeted extreme poverty, health, and education in developing countries are coming to an end in 2015. The newest set of targets, the Sustainable Development Goals, build upon their predecessors and provide the framework for further improvements. As countries gather at the United Nations to reevaluate the MDGs and agree upon the new SDGs, it is the perfect time to explore what a sustainable future looks like and what is currently being done to achieve it. The 2015 UNIS-UN international student conference will examine sustainability in terms of its three interrelated components: the development of our society, the growth of the economies and the impact on the environment. We seek to explore topics such as climate justice, gender equality, and resilient cities, and to uncover how they are all key parts of fostering sustainable development on all levels. Through diverse speakers and open dialogue discussions we hope to engage young minds in the importance and possibilities of designing our sustainable and promising future.
