 The 35th annual UNIS-UN Conference was held on March 3 - 4, 2011. The theme of the conference was "The Web: Wiring our World." In the last decade or so, the Internet has undertaken a key role in every aspect of human life. People all over the world rely on the Internet for information, entertainment, communication, business, social interaction, and many other facets of their lives. The benefits of the development of internet technologies are plenty, but accompanying these benefits are numerous concerns. Regardless of whether it is viewed in a positive or negative light, the advent of the Internet has effectively revolutionized the lives of people in both the developed and developing countries. 
 
 The UNIS-UN conference concentrated on the evolving role of the Internet, and its far-reaching implications in different areas of society. The goal of the conference was to provide insight into a phenomenon that society has universally embraced without fully understanding its transformational powers. The conference examined issues such as the role of the Internet in political movements; the moral and ethical questions concerning the privacy of information; and how the Internet has affected our thought processes and our worldview.
