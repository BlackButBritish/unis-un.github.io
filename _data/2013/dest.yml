 The 2013 conference was centered on change within a generation. Modern Youthquake: A Generation’s Impact, describes what we want the conference to be in only so many words. We had a vision of making this conference one that attendees can look back and think, “I was inspired to change my world.” We hoped to encourage attendees this year to think more deeply into what they believe and what they want to do by inviting speakers who have somehow made a difference in their world which in turn impacted our world, and more importantly our generation. We found dynamic speakers, who could describe how they chose to make a difference in their lives and in the lives of others through a passion that they have. 
 
 We wanted to show each student in attendance that we as a generation don’t need to sit around and wait for other people to make the world a better place to live; we wanted to show them that we can make a difference, that we can be part of a generation’s impact. And just like the youth of the '60s, we wanted to prove that we can change our world, just by doing.
